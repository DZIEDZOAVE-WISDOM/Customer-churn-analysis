# Customer churn analysis

I analyzed a customer churn dataset as part of my tasks during my virtual internship program with PwC Switzerland. The purpose of this analysis was to uncover insights into the factors that lead to customer churn and to develop solutions to minimize it.

Key stakeholder:

Retention manager, Phonenow.

###  Data source
The data was provided by Pwc switzerland, it contains 25 columns and 7043 rows of data on Phonenow's customers.
### Data cleaning and preparation
I downloaded the dataset and imported it into Microsoft Power Bi through power query.
on power query, i checked for these;

1. I checked for Duplicate rows.
2. I also checked if all the columns are in their correct data type.
3. I dropped down each column to see if there are any inconsistencies in the spellings of the records.
4. i checked for NULL values.
5. I created a "customer services" column which summarizes all the services that were subscribed by each customer for the purpose analysis.
6. I also created a new column "Age category" which groups the "senior citizen column" into old and young.



after cleaning the data in power query, I closed and applied the steps i have taken.
## Key research questions
1. What is the customer churn rate?
2. What is the age distribution of churned customers?
3. What were the services subscribed by most churned customers?
4. Which payment method did churned customers used the most?
5. Do churned clients have partners and dependaents?
6. What is the gender distribution of churned clients?
7. What type of contract did most churned customers have?
8. Did most churned customers use paperless billing?
9. what was the number of technical and administarative support tickets submitted by churned clients?

## RECOMMENDATIONS

2. The company should come up with offers that is tailored toward young demogarphics, since they were the most churned customers.

3. measures should be taken to improve sevral services that were subscribed by churned customers, of which phone and internet service were the predominant services used by customers.

4. other payment method other than the "electronic payment method" should be introduced to customers but also, the company should probe into the effectiveness of the electronic payment method to see if there are no frequent issues with that. This is because most churned customers used this payment method.

5. churned customers submitted the most technical support tickets(73.54%), this is a serious indication of customer dissatisfaction. issues reported by customers in relation to these tickets should be made a priority. the company should take a swift decision to resolve those issues.
